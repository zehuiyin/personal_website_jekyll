Above is the map of the admission universities of my high school classmates (2020 Class 7). This heat map is created gerenally by me as a parting gift for my classmates and teachers. Hoping everyone is doing well!<!-- readmore -->

The map is written in Mandarin Chinese. Most of my classmates decided to attend universities at the Eastern coast of China. I have spent two years with these classmates in the last two years in senior high school. It has been a unforgetable memory for me, hopefully for them as well.
