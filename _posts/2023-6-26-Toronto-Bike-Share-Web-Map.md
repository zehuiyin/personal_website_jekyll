This web map shows the results of two spatial analysis projects on Bike Share Toronto stations and routes ([Spatial patterns of seasonal ridership, built environment and social demographics: A taxonomy of Bike Share Toronto stations](https://github.com/zehuiyin/cluster_analysis_toronto_bikeshare) and [Travel speed and routes of the bike-share system: An analysis of Bike Share Toronto](https://github.com/zehuiyin/travel_speed_and_routes_toronto_bikeshare)), using data from 2021. It allows users to explore the seasonal ridership patterns, built environment and social demographics of different station clusters, as well as the travel speed and routes of the bike-share system.

The data for this web map was obtained from the Bike Share Toronto and the City of Toronto Open Data Portal. The spatial analysis was conducted using R. The web map was created using the Leaflet library and OpenStreetMap.
