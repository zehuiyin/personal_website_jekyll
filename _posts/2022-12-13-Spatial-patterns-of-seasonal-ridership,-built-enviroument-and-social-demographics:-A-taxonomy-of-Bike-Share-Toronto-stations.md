This is the term project for an advanced GIS course GGRC30 taught by [Dr. Elnaz Yousefzadeh Barri](https://elnazyousefzadeh.com/) in Fall 2022. In this project, I calculated Earth Moverâ€™s Distance and performs Hierarchical Clustering from Vertx-links to examine the characteristics of the Bike Share Toronto system at station levels as well as provide a taxonomy of the stations. The project focused on two research questions:
-	RQ1. What are the seasonal spatial pattern differences in Toronto bike-share trips at station levels?
-	RQ2. What are the similarities and differences between the locations, trip count percentages, built environments, and social demographics of Toronto bike-share stations?
