This web map, created using ArcGIS Online, was the final project for my first-year GIS course [GGRA30](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/ggra30h3), which was taught by [Dr. Haydn Lawrence](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/haydnlawrence) in the winter of 2021. The map showcases some of the most famous tourist attractions in Nanjing, the capital city of Jiangsu province, including their locations, ticket prices, national levels, and descriptions in attachments.<!-- readmore -->

Nanjing is a city with a rich history, having served as the capital city for six dynasties in the past. As a result, it is home to numerous old buildings, palaces, and city walls that attract tourists from all over the world. With this web map, tourists can easily access information about these famous attractions, helping them to better plan their trips and make the most of their time in Nanjing.

I created this web map with the hope of attracting more people to visit Nanjing and learn about its fascinating history and culture. By providing useful information and making it easily accessible, I hope to encourage more people to explore this beautiful city and appreciate its unique charms.
