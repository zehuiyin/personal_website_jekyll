<p style="text-align: left;">I am an undergraduate student at University of Toronto Scarborough. I major in economics for management studies and minor in GIS and applied statistics. I am very interested in cartography and exploring spatial patterns in social problems. I have experience with Python and R programming. I like to explore insights based on the open data like census. I also have experiences with a variaty of GIS softwares including ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, etc. In the meantime, I am also a transit lover. I enjoys riding buses and trains, which motivates my research interest in public transit.</p>
