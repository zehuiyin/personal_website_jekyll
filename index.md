<p style="text-align: left;">I am an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC), where I am pursuing a major in Economics for Management Studies and two minors in Geographic Information Science (GIS) and Applied Statistics, respectively. As a research assistant in the <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/suburban-mobilities/">Suburban Mobility Cluster</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/geography/steven-farber">Dr. Steven Farber</a> in the Human Geography Department at UTSC, I am also currently exploring ways to improve transportation accessibility and efficiency in suburban areas, with a particular emphasis on Scarborough, Ontario.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">My interests in spatial analysis and econometrics have inspired me to delve into examining the spatial patterns of social issues, with a particular focus on using GIS and statistical tools to visualize and analyze these patterns. With my extensive experience in R programming and proficiency in a variety of GIS software, such as ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online, I am well-equipped to tackle complex spatial and social problems from a quantitative approach.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Moreover, as a passionate transit enthusiast, I find myself constantly drawn to the topic of public transit and transportation. I enjoy riding buses and trains, and this interest has motivated me to explore ways of enhancing the accessibility and efficiency of public transit. I am eager to utilize my interdisciplinary background to further investigate public transit and transportation through spatial analysis and econometrics, with the aim of finding solutions to improve their functionality and accessibility.</p>
